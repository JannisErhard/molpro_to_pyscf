# molpro_to_pyscf
Is taking input from molpro, runs calculations then churns out molpro compatible data. At this point density matrices.

# TODO - one
1. run from small fcidump
2. use read to get orbitals
3. use other function to transform
4. use special print to print to dm
5. paste special into heck-mack
7. compare dm-s 
8. run inversion, compare results 

#TODO -two 
1. get large orbital matrix
2. run from large dump 
3. repeat steps 3 to 8 

# TODO meta 
1. consider a way to print most of the heck-mack data 
2. find a way to print spin matrices
