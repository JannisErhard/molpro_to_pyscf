# molpro_to_pyscf
Is taking input from molpro, runs calculations then churns out molpro compatible data. At this point density matrices.

# TODO - two
- [x] run from small fcidump
- [x] use read to get orbitals
- [x] use other function to transform
- [x] use special print to print to dm
- [ ] paste special into heck-mack
- [ ] compare dm-s 
- [ ] run inversion, compare results 
- 
# TODO - three 
- [ ] get large orbital matrix
- [ ] run from large dump 
- [ ] repeat steps 3 to 8 

# TODO - meta 
- [ ] consider a way to print most of the heck-mack data 
- [ ] find a way to print spin matrices
- [x] write other function to transform
